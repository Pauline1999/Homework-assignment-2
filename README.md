Computational musicology 

Since last week I had two inital ideas, I now decided to use this research question: 
How does the famous music style "Reggeaton" differ from German hip hop? 
Why is Reggeaton growing in popularity all around the world and German Hip Hop is not? Can we find a possible answer to this question?

Because after doing a lot of analyses I realized, it might be better to use playlists that include new but also old songs. The playlists I was going to use before included only the newest songs from each music style. I also decided not to use the playlists I created but rather use the most accurate ones I can find created by Spotify as this would exclude my subjective musical taste. Therefore, I do not project the tables and data from the analyses in this assignment but only the ones I created afterwards with the new playlists. 
The playlist I am using for the music style of Reggeaton is called "Reggeaton Classics" and includes 99 songs, which I think is very suitable. 
For the German Hip Hop I found a playlist by Spotify called "Deutschrap: Die Klassiker" but it only includes 50 songs. As I did not know if that is a problem I decided to create a new playlist including this and a second playlist by Spotify called "Modus Mio", and according to Spotify, it is the most important Hip-Hop playlists in Germany. I called this new playlist "German HipHop Classics". This playlist therefore ended with 100 songs. 

These are my tables for Reggeaton:
